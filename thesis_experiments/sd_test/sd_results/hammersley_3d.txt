  C++ version

  Compiled on Aug 18 2021 at 11:07:14.

  A program to estimate the discrepancy
  of a set of N points in M dimensions.

FILE_USAGE:
  This program requires an input file that defines
  the point set.
  We assume that the points are S-dimensional, and 
  that there are N_MAX of them.

  We also require that the points be in the unit hypercube.

  Then the input file contains N_MAX lines or records.
  Each record contains the S coordinate values of one point.

  Comment lines begin with the character "#",
  and may occur anywhere in the file.

  At runtime, the user specifies N, the number of points
  to be read from the file, which must be less than or
  equal to N_MAX.

  Here is an example of a file containing N_MAX = 5
  points in S = 3 dimensions:

#  input_3x5.txt
#
#  Suitable for input to DISCRBOUND.
#  Spatial dimension = 3
#  Number of points = 5
#
  0.00  0.20  0.90
  0.80  0.40  0.30
  0.20  1.00  0.50
  0.40  0.60  0.10
  0.60  0.80  0.70


  S = 3
  Epsilon = 0.001
  N = 100
